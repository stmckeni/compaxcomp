# compaxcomp
a ide written in pyqt5 for addressing specific handicaps. 

all the files located in compax_comp folder. nem.py is where the main file is contained.

I added the rxvt-unicode terminal for embedding and should run without the need for the dependencies or the actual terminal installed on your linux system itself. If you have trouble with your terminal, please let me know.

RXVT was originally written by Rob Nation and later extensively modified by Mark Olesen, who took over maintenance for several years. It is intended to be a slimmed-down alternate for xterm , omitting some of its little-used features, like Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit -style configurability.

as of january 1st, 2020, you will need to use py installer to get an executable or use at least python 3.7+ to get it working. Will not work with python2 as pyqt5 is not compatible with python2. 3.5 is rumored to support all the pyqt5 libs but proven and written with python 3.7 with exclusive compatibility with python 3.8. I had to compile 3.8 from source since 3.8 is not yet available for linux. (or it is, if you compile from the python 3.8 source code.)
